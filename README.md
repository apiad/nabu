# Nabu Voice Notes

**Nabu Voice Notes** is an open-source application designed for secure and private voice-based note-taking. Inspired by the ancient Mesopotamian god of writing and wisdom, Nabu empowers users to capture their thoughts and insights effortlessly while ensuring complete control over their data.

## Features of the App

- **Local Storage**: All voice recordings, transcriptions, and post-processed notes are stored securely on your device, ensuring that your notes remain private and are never stored in the cloud.

- **Secure Server-Side Processing**: The app utilizes server-side processing solely for transcription and intermediary tasks, with no final information retained on the server, prioritizing user privacy.

- **Fully Open Source**: Nabu Voice Notes is completely open source, allowing you to download, modify, and run your own version of the app without any cost. You can also host your own server for transcription and processing if desired (see [License](#license) for details).

- **Customizable Note Processing**: Create custom prompts to apply various post-processing features to your notes. This can include tasks like summarization, actionable item extraction, and follow-up question generation, allowing you to tailor how your notes are processed based on your specific needs. By default, three modules are provided:

  - **Actionable Item Extraction**: Automatically extracts actionable items from your notes and presents them as bullet points at the end of each entry.

  - **Follow-Up Questions Generation**: Generates relevant follow-up questions based on the content of your notes to encourage deeper reflection.

  - **Summary Generation**: Provides brief summaries for longer notes, making it easier to review key points quickly.

- **Seamless Server Switching**: Easily switch between official servers and personal servers within the same app without losing any notes. If you run out of credits, all your current notes and local use remain intact—you don’t lose anything.
